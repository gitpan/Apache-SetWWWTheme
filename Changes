1.03  Tue Feb 01 19:28:51 2000
	- fixed bug in auto HTML cleaning routine
	  (ie that bit that puts in missing </HEAD> tags, 
	   etc.)

1.04  Mon Feb 14 16:05:11 2000
	- addes "printable" support to allow servers
	  to send out un-themed pages without subverting
	  the entire theming process.

1.05  Tues Mar 21 19:01:11 2000
	- fixed "printable" generation so that it 
          uses GET methods rather than the ridiculous
	  virtual directory method I had cooked up
	  in 1.04.  :) 

1.06  Thurs Mar 23 22:02:42 2000
    - added support for escaped semi-colons in directives
      (eg @MORELINKSTITLE=More Links\;; goes to "More Links;"
      This was added at the request of the JAC for embedding 
      Javascript.  Use it wisely.  Note that the escaping is
      simple-minded..... You can't escape escapes, for example.
    - added support for @SIDEBARWIDTH directive.  The sidebar
      width was previously set to 150 pixels.
    - added support for @NOSIDEBAREXTRAS directive.  This turns
      off all but the @SIDEBARMENULINKS (ie no search box,
      stuff like that).
